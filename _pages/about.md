Hello! My name is Wenhao Liu, and I come from Beijing in China. I'm a graduate student in University of Southern California right now, majoring Electrical Engineering. I completed my Bacholar of Science degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation from [Beijing Information Science & Technology University](https://www.bistu.edu.cn/) in China with a GPA of 86.8/100, fourth in the whole grade. During my undergraduate years, I learned various electrical specialized courses, such as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Electrical Machinery</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Power and Electronics Technology</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Automatic Control Theory</span>, and many others. These courses helped me build a framework of knowledge in the electrical field and trained my ability to use some tools like MATLAB, Altium Designer, AutoCAD, and Quartus. In addition, I have gained experience of using Python, Pytorch, Fusion 360, and STM32. 

Something I'm interested in
======
In my spare time, I like playing games and making models. After I learned embedded design by myself, I began to enjoy drawing the circuits and programming them to implement some functions. Besides, I'm also interested in learning about digital products like computers, so I sometimes help my friends choose laptops or desktop accessories and even install their computers for free. 

In terms of study, I'm more inclined to learn and do some things that can have practical applications. Because most of the projects I have been involved in since my undergraduate degree are hardware-oriented, I want to learn more about theory and algorithm application in engineering during my graduate study to satisfy my curiosity and enrich my technology stack, especially in robotics. 

Some of my experiences
======
Shortly after I started my undergraduate degree in 2019, I joined the Drone Club and the RERA Robot Competition Club in our university to find out what I really like. It is interesting that I learned how to use modeling software like Proe in the Drone Club, and I got the experience of using FDM 3D-printer in the RERA Club. At the end of my freshman year, I participated in the 2019 China Robot Competition as an operator with my RERA Club teammates and got second prize in the Rescue Robot - Environment Independent Mapping Project.

In the summer of my sophomore year in 2020, I had an internship related to Deep Learning at [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.ia.cas.cn/). My work was to use Convolutional Neural Networks for garbage classification, and I finally trained a model with an accuracy of 0.85 based on ResNet using thousands of different garbage training datasets by Python and Pytorch. Through this internship, I experienced the atmosphere of the laboratory and learned how to select and modify a network to train a model. 

In the summer of my junior year in 2021, I atteneded UCSD professor Mercier's online summer course, which is about the design of Wearable Electrocardiography (ECG)/ Electroencephalogram (EEG) sensor technologies. During this course, I learned some basic knowledge of bioelectronic engineering, and I designed a low-power biomedical instrument amplifier for ECG/EEG detection with my groupmate. After the course, I wrote and published a review of hardware design and machine learning algorithms for wearable EEG devices. With my current perspective, what I learned in writing this article is more valuable than itself.

At the end of my undergraduate year, I chose to develop a motor controller as my graduate design because I have wanted to do something like this for a long time and one of my professors happend to have this topic. And I finally succeed in designing a controller of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Control System Based on STM32 and Field Oriented Control (FOC) algorithms.
