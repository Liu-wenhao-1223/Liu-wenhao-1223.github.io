Hello! My name is Wenhao Liu, and I come from Beijing in China. I'm a graduate student in University of Southern California right now, majoring Electrical Engineering. I completed my Bacholar of Science degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation from [Beijing Information Science & Technology University](https://www.bistu.edu.cn/) in China with a GPA of 86.8/100, fourth in the whole grade. During my undergraduate years, I learned various electrical specialized courses, such as Electrical Machinery, Power and Electronics Technology, Automatic Control Theory and many others. These courses helped me build a framework of the knowledge in elctrical field and trained my ability to use some tools like MATLAB, Altium Designer, AutoCAD, and Quartus.  

Shortly after I started my undergraduate degree in 2019, I joined the Drone Club and the RERA Robot Competition Club in our university to find out what I really like. It is interesting that I learned how to use modeling software like Proe in the Drone Club, and I got the experience of using FDM 3D-printer in the RERA Club. At the end of my freshman year, I participated in the 2019 China Robot Competition as an operator with my RERA Club teammates and got second prize in the Rescue Robot - Environment Independent Mapping Project.

In the summer of my second year of college, I had an internship related to Deep Learning in [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.ia.cas.cn/). My work was to use Convolutional Neural Networks for garbage classification, and I finally trained a model with an accuracy of 0.85 based on Resnet using thousands of different garbage training datasets. Through this internship, I experienced the atmosphere of the laboratory and learned how to select and modify a network to train a model.
