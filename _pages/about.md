Hello! My name is Wenhao Liu, and I come from Beijing in China. I'm a graduate student in University of Southern California right now, majoring Electrical Engineering. I completed my Bacholar of Science degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation from [Beijing Information Science & Technology University](https://www.bistu.edu.cn/) in China with a GPA of 86.8/100, fourth in the whole grade. During my undergraduate years, I learned various electrical specialized courses, such as Electrical Machinery, Power and Electronics Technology, Automatic Control Theory, and many others. These courses helped me build a framework of knowledge in the electrical field and trained my ability to use some tools like MATLAB, Altium Designer, AutoCAD, and Quartus II. In addition, I have gained experience using Python, Pytorch, Fusion 360, and STM32 from some projects I participated in. 

In my spare time, I like making models by hand or by 3D printers. After I learned embedded design by myself, I began to enjoy drawing the circuits and programming them to implement some functions. Besides, I'm also interested in learning about new digital products like computers and new VR/XR devices, so I often give my friends advice on choosing laptops or desktop accessories and even installing their computers for free. 

In terms of study, I'm more inclined to learn and do some things that can have practical applications like embedded systems and brain-computer interface. Because most of the projects I have been involved in since my undergraduate degree are hardware-oriented, I want to learn more about theory and algorithm application in engineering during my graduate study. Specifically, I'm interested in exploring the integration of computer vision with manipulators, both to satisfy my desire to explore and create something meaningful. 

Some of my experiences
======
Shortly after I started my undergraduate degree in 2019, I joined the Drone Club and the RERA Robot Competition Club at our university to find out what I really like. Interestingly, I learned how to use modeling software like Proe in the Drone Club, and I got the experience of using FDM 3D printers in the RERA Club. At the end of my freshman year, I participated in the 2019 China Robot Competition as an operator with my RERA Club teammates and got second prize in the Rescue Robot - Environment Independent Mapping Project.

In the summer of my sophomore year in 2020, I had an internship related to Deep Learning at [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.ia.cas.cn/). My work was to use Convolutional Neural Networks for garbage classification, and I finally trained a model with an accuracy of 0.85 based on ResNet using thousands of different garbage training datasets by Python and Pytorch. Through this internship, I experienced the atmosphere of the laboratory and learned how to select and modify a network to train a model. 

In the summer of my junior year in 2021, I atteneded UCSD professor Mercier's online summer course, which is about the design of Wearable Electrocardiography (ECG)/ Electroencephalogram (EEG) sensor technologies. During this course, I learned some basic knowledge of bioelectronic engineering, and I designed a low-power biomedical instrument amplifier for ECG/EEG detection with my groupmate. After the course, I wrote and published a review of hardware design and machine learning algorithms for wearable EEG devices. With my current perspective, what I learned in writing this article is more valuable than itself.

At the end of my undergraduate year, I chose to develop a motor controller as my graduate design because I have wanted to do something like this for a long time and one of my professors happend to have this topic. And I finally succeed in designing a controller of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Control System Based on STM32 and Field Oriented Control (FOC) algorithms.
