Hello! My name is Wenhao Liu, and I come from Beijing in China. I'm a graduate student in University of Southern California right now, majoring Electrical Engineering. I completed my Bacholar of Science degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation from [Beijing Information Science & Technology University](https://www.bistu.edu.cn/) in China with a GPA of 86.8/100, fourth in the whole grade. During my undergraduate years, I learned various electrical specialized courses, such as Electrical Machinery, Power and Electronics Technology, Automatic Control Theory and many others. These courses helped me build a framework of the knowledge in elctrical field and trained my ability to use some tools like MATLAB, Altium Designer, AutoCAD, and Quartus.  

Shortly after I started my undergraduate degree in 2019, I joined the Drone Club and the RERA Robot Competition Club in our university to find out what I really like. It is interesting that I learned how to use modeling software like Proe in the Drone Club, and I got the experience of using FDM 3D-printer in the RERA Club. At the end of my freshman year, I participated in the 2019 China Robot Competition as an operator with my RERA Club teammates and got second prize in the Rescue Robot - Environment Independent Mapping Project.

In the summer of my sophomore year in 2020, I had an internship related to Deep Learning in [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.ia.cas.cn/). My work was to use Convolutional Neural Networks for garbage classification, and I finally trained a model with an accuracy of 0.85 based on ResNet using thousands of different garbage training datasets. Through this internship, I experienced the atmosphere of the laboratory and learned how to select and modify a network to train a model. 

In the summer of my sophomore year in 2021, I atteneded UCSD professor Mercier's online summer course about, which is about the design of Wearable Electrocardiography (ECG)/ Electroencephalogram (EEG) sensor technologies. During this course, I learned some basic knowledge of bioelectronic engineering, and I designed a low-power biomedical instrument amplifier for ECG/EEG detection in need of higher gain, specified bandwidth, high common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) and low noise with my groupmate. After the course, I wrote and published a review of hardware design and machine learning algorithms for wearable EEG devices. With my current perspective, what I learned in writing this article is more valuable than itself.

At the end of my undergraduate year, I chose to develop a motor controller as my graduate design because I have wanted to do something like this for a long time and one of my professors happend to have this topic. And I finally succeed in designing a controller of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Control System Based on STM32 and Field Oriented Control (FOC) algorithms.

Something I'm interested in
======
In my spare time, I like playing games and making models. In addition to playing with robot models produced by model companies, I also like to model and print them by myself. I once bought an FDM 3D printer and a DLP 3D printer at my own expense to make models during my undergraduate years, although most of the products were of poor accuracy because these printers were very cheap. After I learned embedded design by myself, I began to enjoy drawing the circuits and programming them to implement some functions. Besides, I'm also interested in learning about digital products like computers, so I sometimes help my friends choose laptops or desktop accessories and even install their computers for free. Most of the projects I have been involved in since my undergraduate degree are hardware oriented, so I want to learn more about algorithm application in engineering during my graduate study to satisfy my curiosity and enrich my technology stack.
