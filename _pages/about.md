Hello! My name is Wenhao Liu, and I come from Beijing in China. I'm a graduate student in University of Southern California right now, majoring Electrical Engineering. I completed my Bacholar of Science degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation from [Beijing Information Science & Technology University](https://www.bistu.edu.cn/) in China with a GPA of 86.8/100, fourth in the whole grade. During my undergraduate years, I learned various electrical specialized courses, such as Electrical Machinery, Power and Electronics Technology, Automatic Control Theory, and many others. These courses helped me build a framework of knowledge in the electrical field and trained my ability to use some tools like MATLAB, Altium Designer, AutoCAD, and Quartus II. In addition, I have gained experience using Python, Pytorch, Qt, Fusion 360, and STM32 from some projects I participated in. 

In my spare time, I like making models by hand or by 3D printers. After I learned embedded design by myself, I began to enjoy drawing the circuits and programming them to implement some functions. Besides, I'm also interested in learning about new digital products like computers and new VR/XR devices, so I often give my friends advice on choosing laptops or desktop accessories and even installing their computers for free. 

In terms of study, I'm more inclined to learn and do some things that can have practical applications like embedded systems and brain-computer interface. Because most of the projects I have been involved in since my undergraduate degree are hardware-oriented, I want to learn more about theory and algorithm application in engineering during my graduate study. Specifically, I'm interested in exploring the integration of computer vision with manipulators, both to satisfy my desire to explore and create something meaningful.
