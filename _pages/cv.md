Some of my experiences
======
Shortly after I started my undergraduate degree in 2019, I joined the Drone Club and the RERA Robot Competition Club at our university to find out what I really like. Interestingly, I learned how to use modeling software like Proe in the Drone Club, and I got the experience of using FDM 3D printers in the RERA Club. At the end of my freshman year, I participated in the 2019 China Robot Competition as an operator with my RERA Club teammates and got second prize in the Rescue Robot - Environment Independent Mapping Project.

In the summer of my sophomore year in 2020, I had an internship related to Deep Learning at [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.ia.cas.cn/). My work was to use Convolutional Neural Networks for garbage classification, and I finally trained a model with an accuracy of 0.85 based on ResNet using thousands of different garbage training datasets by Python and Pytorch. Through this internship, I experienced the atmosphere of the laboratory and learned how to select and modify a network to train a model. 

In the summer of my junior year in 2021, I atteneded UCSD professor Mercier's online summer course, which is about the design of Wearable Electrocardiography (ECG)/ Electroencephalogram (EEG) sensor technologies. During this course, I learned some basic knowledge of bioelectronic engineering, and I designed a low-power biomedical instrument amplifier for ECG/EEG detection with my groupmate. After the course, I wrote and published a review of hardware design and machine learning algorithms for wearable EEG devices. With my current perspective, what I learned in writing this article is more valuable than itself.

At the end of my undergraduate year, I chose to develop a motor controller as my graduate design because I have wanted to do something like this for a long time and one of my professors happend to have this topic. And I finally succeed in designing a controller of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Control System Based on STM32 and Field Oriented Control (FOC) algorithms.
