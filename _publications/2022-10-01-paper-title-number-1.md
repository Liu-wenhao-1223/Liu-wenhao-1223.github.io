title: "Application of EEG in wearable brain-computer interfaces"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'The Electroencephalography (EEG) based brain-computer interfaces is a convenient way to use brain waves to investigate different emotions and some mental disorders. With the development of research and design, it is even possible to use brain waves to control devices (such as robot arms) to improve the life of the disabled. On this basis, based on the summary of previous research results, this paper focuses on the analog front-end of wearable brain computer interface (especially electrode and amplifier) and its related algorithms. The algorithms are developed on the basis of some classical machine learning algorithms, which are more suitable for EEG signals like common spatial paternal and long short-term memory network. This article may provide some convenience and inspiration for future development of EEG-based brain-machine interfaces.'
