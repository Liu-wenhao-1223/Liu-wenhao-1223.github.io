These are my notes on learning how to use Mujoco in Python. I record these just more in case I forget if I don't use it for a while. For example, I spent a few days figuring out how to built a Minecraft server to play with my classmates when I was a undergraduate student. At that time I even know how to edit Mod documents to resolve key conflicts, but now I just remember how to open the server. I will be glad if you clicked here by a strange coincidence and thought it would helpful.

I will keep updating this note.
