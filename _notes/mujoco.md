These are my notes on learning how to use Mujoco in Python. I record these just more in case I forget if I don't use it for a while. I used to spend a few days figuring out how to build a Minecraft server to play with my classmates when I was an undergraduate student. I even knew how to edit Mod documents to resolve key mapping conflicts at that time, but now I just remember how to open the server. I would be glad if you clicked here by a strange coincidence and thought it would be helpful.
