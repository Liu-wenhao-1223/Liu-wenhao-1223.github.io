This is my summary of the selection of graduate courses at USC. I think it is useful to the students who major in ECE [Machine Learning & Data Science](https://catalogue.usc.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=18&poid=25983&returnto=7300) and EE general students who are going to choose the learning track of [Computer Architecture](https://catalogue.usc.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=18&poid=25921&returnto=7300), [VLSI Design](https://catalogue.usc.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=18&poid=25474&returnto=7300) or [Robotics](https://catalogue.usc.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=18&poid=25465&returnto=7299). 

*Some courses may not open during your semester, so you can check the [USC Schedule of Classes](https://classes.usc.edu/) first.
*You can find your advisor's contact information from this [link](https://viterbigrad.usc.edu/academic-advisement/).
*The 1st semester of ECE students are not allowed to take the CS courses.

For ECE Machine Learning & Data Science([English]/[Chinese](../../files/Course_selection/Course_selection_MLDS_CN.pdf)):

For EE VLSI([English]/[Chinese](../../files/Course_selection/Course_selection_VLSI_CN.pdf)):

I will keep updating this note.
